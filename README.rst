pyFlies
=======

`pyFlies <http://igordejanovic.github.io/pyFlies/>`_ is a Domain-Specific
Language (DSL) for cognitive experiments modeling.  It is meant to be simple to
learn and readable.

A code for various run-time platforms can be generated from the experiment
description.  Futhermore, model can be directly interpreted if the run-time
supports pyFlies.

The documentation is available `here <http://igordejanovic.github.io/pyFlies/>`_
