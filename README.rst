pyFlies
=======

pyFlies is a domain-specific language (DSL) for behaviour experiments modeling.
It is meant to be simple to learn and readable.

A code for various run-time platforms can be generated from the experiment description.
Futhermore, model can be directly interpreted if the run-time supports pyFlies.

Installation
------------

::

    pip install pyFlies
