      Welcome
      -------
      In the following test you will be presented with a blank screen
      where a white square will appear after a few seconds.
      You should react by pressing the space bar as fast as you can when
      the square appears.

      This is a practice test with 3 trials.
      Afterwards the real test will run with 30 trials.

      Press space bar
      ================

      # This test will run in practice mode.
      # This mode tells experiment runner
      # not to collect any sample data.
      test mytest_3 practice

      ================
      Real test with 30 trials
      ------------------------
      Press space bar
      ================
      # This is the real test run. Samples will be collected.
      Test mytest_30

    }

    # This is here just to show that randomize block should contain
    # more than 1 block. Those block runs will be randomized.
